### The Gaming Room is a client looking to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The Gaming Room requirements were for the application to render images from an extensive library of stock drawings as clues n the user’s device.

### I conducted thorough research on architecture, design patterns, and operating platforms. This process was helpful and showed me how much work goes into building an application. Once the design pattern has been selected, this greatly influences how the code will be written.

### I would revisit the document revision history and make it more detailed so that another engineer, or even a non-technical person, could trace all the steps taken to design the application.

### The application required storing an extensive library of images that needed to be accessed randomly and instantly. You will often find yourself working with non-technical individuals who know what they want but are unfamiliar with how applications are built. This being said, translating the client’s requirements into technical specs that fulfill their requests is paramount.

### My approach to designing software was to get the essentials, write out pseudo-code for everything, then slowly start coding getting one thing to work at a time. I was just focusing on the coding. I now realize that selecting the appropriate design pattern is essential. This class has shown me that much more preparation is done before doing any coding.
